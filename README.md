# Music-Recommender---Machine-Learning-1
This is a simple project using a simple data of the list of music various categories of adults and gender (male and female) to predict the type of music a certain person may like based on age and gender. 

The Model has an accuracy scope ranging between 75% to 100%. The model was tested and confirmed that it provides accurate predictions. 
In this model, i use **JobLib package** to create the model and save in my machine to avoid retraining of the model and maintain its persistence.
